You’ll find here a walkthru of what will eventually be all the glyphs in
Dyalog APL, in an order where no glyph is used in an example until it’s
been introduced. So far there’s no prose – the explanations are purely
through examples for now (but we’ll add prose later).

There’s also a [Python equivalents](python.ipynb) notebook, which has
explanations using python of some APL ideas, including `bind`/`partial`
and APL operators (aka higher-order functions).
